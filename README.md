# AchievementFirst

CONTEXT
As part of AF’s mission to close the achievement gap for our scholars, we enroll students from neighborhoods
that traditionally have low student achievement. As a consequence, it is not surprising that students will enter
the 5th grade significantly below grade level. We are committed to helping all students read at grade level by
the end of 8
th grade.

The Fountas and Pinnell benchmark assessment system and leveled literacy intervention system
(http://www.heinemann.com/fountasandpinnell/) is used in AF schools from grades K‐8 to measure student
progress in achieving reading mastery. The assessment is administered individually to each scholar by a teacher.
The scholar reads increasingly more challenging levels of text while the teacher checks for mastery. Once the
scholar reaches the limit of what he or she can read and comprehend, the scholar is assigned an F&P score that
corresponds with the level of reading mastery that he or she demonstrated.
The teacher uses the scholar’s F&P score to assign the scholar to one of four F&P reading proficiency levels:
remedial, below proficient, proficient, or advanced. The conversion of the F&P score into proficiency levels is
based on the scholar’s reading level, grade level and the phase of the school year.
GOAL
Assuming the role of a Data Analyst for AF, analyze the provided data set (F&P Sample Data Set.xlsx) and
prepare a set of findings as you would present them to the AF leadership team and school principals.
NOTES ON THE DATA SET
The dataset contains the F&P assessment results of numerous scholars from two AF middle schools. Each row in
the dataset represents a single student and contains the student’s beginning of year (BOY) and end of year (EOY)
F&P reading scores.
Note that this dataset contains source data with limited data validation. As a result, some modest data cleanup
may be required.
It will be necessary to use the information contained within the “F&P Proficiency levels” tab to convert raw F&P
scores into their respective proficiency levels.

ANALYSIS QUESTIONS
Please consider at least the following questions in your analysis:
1. How are the two middle schools doing in reading?
2. How does performance compare across the two schools and grades? Are the schools on track to closing
the achievement gap?
3. Do you have any concerns or other notes with your analysis?
As the primary metric for performance, you should consider the percent of students that are proficient or
advanced.
